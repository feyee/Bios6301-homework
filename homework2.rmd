This assignment won't be submitted until we've covered Rmarkdown.
Create R chunks for each question and insert your R code appropriately.
Check your output by using the `Knit PDF` button in RStudio.

1. **Working with data** In the `datasets` folder on the course GitHub repo, you will find a file called `cancer.csv`, which is a dataset in comma-separated values (csv) format. This is a large cancer incidence dataset that summarizes the incidence of different cancers for various subgroups. (18 points)

1. Load the data set into R and make it a data frame called `cancer.df`. (2 points)
```{r}
cancer.df <- read.csv("https://github.com/fonnesbeck/Bios6301/raw/master/datasets/cancer.csv", header=TRUE)
head(cancer.df)
```
2. Determine the number of rows and columns in the data frame. (2)
```{r}
nrow(cancer.df)
ncol(cancer.df)
```
3. Extract the names of the columns in `cancer.df`. (2)
```{r}
colnames(cancer.df)
```
4. Report the value of the 3000th row in column 6. (2)
```{r}
cancer.df[3000, 6]
```
5. Report the contents of the 172nd row. (2)
```{r}
cancer.df[172,]
```
6. Create a new column that is the incidence *rate* (per 100,000) for each row.(3)
```{r}
cancer.df$incidence_rate <- (cancer.df$incidence/cancer.df$population)*100000 
```
7. How many subgroups (rows) have a zero incidence rate? (2)
```{r}
sum(cancer.df$incidence_rate==0)
```
8. Find the subgroup with the highest incidence rate.(3)
```{r}
cancer.df[which.max(cancer.df$incidence_rate),]
```

2. **Data types** (10 points)
1. Create the following vector: `x <- c("5","12","7")`. 
Which of the following commands will produce an error message? 
For each command, Either explain why they should be errors, or explain the non-erroneous result. (4 points)
```{r}
x <- c("5","12","7")
max(x)
```
The characters are sorted according to their first digit , therefore 7>5>1 and you return the value "7"
```{r}
sort(x) 
```
Again the characters are sorted by their first digit 1<5<7, you return the values "12" "5" "7" 

sum(x)

Error, the class of vector x is a character and you can only sum numeric complex or logical values
```
2. For the next two commands, either explain their results, or why they should produce errors. (3 points)
```{r}
y <- c("5",7,12)
```
Since "5" is a character, the whole vector is read as a character because it is the least flexible and you return the values "5" "7" "12" 

y[2] + y[3] 

Error, again here you are trying to take the sum of two characters because when you call y[2] you are returning the element found at the second position of y but it is returned in character form

3. For the next two commands, either explain their results, or why they should produce errors. (3 points)
```{r}
z <- data.frame(z1="5",z2=7,z3=12) 
```
We get a data frame with z1 z2 and z3 the column names and 5 7 12 in the first row #since we have assigned z as a data frame, this function converts character variables to factors
```{r}
z[1,2] + z[1,3]
```
Addition works here because the values are numeric and you return a value of 19

3. **Data structures** Give R expressions that return the following matrices and vectors (*i.e.* do not construct them manually). (3 points each, 12 total)

1. $(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)$
```{r}
x <- c(1:8,7:1)
```
2. $(1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,5,5,5,5,5)$
```{r}
x <- rep(1:5, c(1,2,3,4,5))
```
3. $\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 & 1  \\
1 & 0 & 1  \\
1 & 1 & 0  \\
\end{pmatrix}$
```{r}
  matrix(1, 3, 3) - diag(3)
```
4. $\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\
1 & 4 & 9 & 16 \\
1 & 8 & 27 & 64  \\
1 & 16 & 81 & 256 \\
1 & 32 & 243 & 1024  \\
\end{pmatrix}$
```{r}
mx <- matrix(rep(1:4, 5),5,4,byrow = TRUE)
(mx <- mx ^ row(mx))
```

4. **Basic programming** (10 points)

1. Let $h(x,n)=1+x+x^2+\ldots+x^n = \sum_{i=0}^n x^i$. Write an R program to calculate $h(x,n)$ using a `for` loop. (5 points)
```{r}
h <- function(x, n){
  sum = 0
  for (i in seq(n)){
    sum = sum + x^i
  }
  return(sum)
}
```
2. If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Write an R program to perform the following calculations. (5 points)

2. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1,000. (3, [euler1])
```{r}
sum <- function(x = 1000){
  sum = 0
  for (i in 1:x-1){
    if(i%%3 == 0 | i%%5 == 0)
      sum = sum + i
  }
  return(sum)
}
sum()
```
3. Find the sum of all the multiples of 4 or 7 below 1,000,000. (2)
```{r}
sum <- function(x = 1000000){
  sum = 0
  for (i in 1:x-1){
    if(i%%4 == 0 | i%%7 == 0)
      sum = sum + i
  }
  return(sum)
}
sum()
```
4. Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be $(1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89)$. Write an R program to calculate the sum of the first 15 even-valued terms. (5 bonus points, [euler2])
c(1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89)

count <- 1
sum <- 2
while (count < 15) {
  i <- i+1
  x<-c(x,x[i]+x[i+1])
  if (x[i+1]%%2==0) {
    count <- c(count,x[i+1])
    sum <- sum+1 
}  
sum
```
